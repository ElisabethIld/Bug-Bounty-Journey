# ðŸ§  PHASE 4: Mastery + Give Back (7â€“12 months and beyond)

ðŸŽ¯ **My Goal:**  
Become highly skilled, confident, and recognized in the bug bounty community.  
Give back by sharing knowledge and helping others grow too.

ðŸ“š **Iâ€™m learning:**  
- Advanced web attacks (prototype pollution, desync, race conditions)  
- Custom payload crafting and fuzzing  
- Advanced recon and automation  
- Creating personal tools or scripts

ðŸ›  **Iâ€™m practicing on:**  
- High-tier private programs  
- My own lab environments to test edge cases  
- Collaborating with other hunters  
- Participating in CTFs and live hacking events

ðŸ§  **My focus now:**  
Be a consistent and valuable contributor in the field.  
Build a strong portfolio (maybe even speak at conferences or write technical blogs).  
Iâ€™m no longer just learning â€” Iâ€™m **teaching**, **sharing**, and **leading**.
