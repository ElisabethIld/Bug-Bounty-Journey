# ðŸ§ª PHASE 2: Level Up Skills + First Real Bug (2â€“4 months)

ðŸŽ¯ **My Goal:**  
Get more confident.  
Start understanding more complex bugs and hopefully report my first real vulnerability.

ðŸ“š **Iâ€™m learning:**  
- Deeper web concepts (CORS, authentication, sessions, APIs)  
- More OWASP bugs: CSRF, Open Redirect, SSRF, SQLi  
- How bug bounty platforms work: HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti  
- How to write a good bug report

ðŸ›  **Iâ€™m practicing on:**  
- More TryHackMe rooms (intermediate level)  
- PortSwigger Academy (labs on the new OWASP bugs)  
- Bug bounty platforms (starting to look for low-hanging bugs)  
- Doing CTFs

ðŸ§  **My focus now:**  
Try to find and report my **first real bug**, even if it's a low severity one.  
Learn from others' reports, stay patient, and donâ€™t be afraid to fail. Itâ€™s part of the process!
