# 🛡️ PHASE 3: Get Consistent + Build My Reputation (4–7 months)

🎯 **My Goal:**  
Find bugs more often.  
Become faster at testing, better at reporting, and start getting some real results and invites.

📚 **I’m learning:**  
- Recon (finding targets, subdomains, endpoints)  
- Automation with tools and scripts  
- Vulnerability chaining (combining small bugs into big impact)  
- Deep dives into fewer targets (quality over quantity)

🛠 **I’m practicing on:**  
- Public and private programs on HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti  
- Recon platforms like Assetnote, Chaos, ProjectDiscovery tools  
- Writing clean, professional reports  
- Creating content (write-ups, notes)

🧠 **My focus now:**  
Improve my **recon and reporting game**, be more efficient, and start building a real **name in the community**.  
One step closer to becoming a pro.
