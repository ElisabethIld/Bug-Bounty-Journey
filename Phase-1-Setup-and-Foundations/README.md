# 🔍 PHASE 1: Basics + Start Finding Easy Bugs (0–2 months)

🎯 **My Goal:**  
Build a strong base.  
Start practicing with real bugs and super simple CTFs (Capture The Flag challenges).

📚 **I’m learning:**  
- How the web works: HTTP, HTML, forms, cookies, sessions.  
- The OWASP Top 10 (the 10 most common web bugs).  
- How to use important tools like:
  - Browsers with extensions (FoxyProxy, Wappalyzer)  
  - Burp Suite (Community version – free)

🛠 **I’m already practicing on:**  
- Hack The Box Academy  
- PortSwigger Web Security Academy  
- TryHackMe (I’m doing beginner rooms like “Intro to Pentesting” and “OWASP Top 10”)  
- Hacktivity (I read real bug reports to learn from others)

🧠 **My focus now:**  
I’m starting with **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** and **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)**.  
They’re common bugs and you don’t need to be a tech genius to find them. Just practice and observe carefully!
