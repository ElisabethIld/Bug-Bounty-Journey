Internet Security Controls



1) Content Encoding:

  - Base64 - transport images, web messages.
            Uppercase and lowercase A to Z, 0 to 9, +, /, = (character for padding).

  - Base64url - a modified version of base64 used for the URL format. 
              Uses different non-alphanumeric characters and omits padding.

  - Hex (Hexadecimal encoding) - base-16 format, 0 to F.
              Takes up more space and is less efficient than base64.

  - URL encoding - its designated hex number preceded by a % symbol (ex. localhost - %6c%6f%63%61%6c%68%6f%73%74).

2) Session-Based Authentication:

  - Session Management -  website remembers your session. Allows the server to handle multiple requests from the same user.
                        The server will assign an associated **session ID** for your browser that serves as proof of your identity.

  - HTTP Cookies - are small pieces of data that web servers send to your browser.
                  The server creates a session for you and sends the session ID to your browser as a cookie.



4) Token-Based Authentication:

    System stores this info directly in some sort of token.
    Tokens allow servers to deduce your identity by decoding the token itself. 
    This way, applications won’t have to store and maintain session information server-side.

  - Signatures - used to verify the integrity of a piece of data. 
                They are special strings that can be generated only if you know a secret key.



5) JSON Web Tokens (JWT):

      It has three components: 
          - a header, 
          - a payload, and 
          - a signature. 

  - Header - identifies the algorithm used to generate the signature (base64url encoded string).

  - Payload - about the user’s identity (base64url encoded).

  - Signature - validates that the user hasn’t tampered with the token (concatenating the header with the payload).

    Most common types of signing algorithms for JWTs:
                - HMAC (signed with a key and later verified with the same key),
                - RSA (created with a private key and later verified with the public key).


  Brute-Force - also be possible to guess the key used to sign a JWT (the attacker has a lot of information to start with).

  More examples of JWT vulnerabilities - search term "JWT security issues".



6) The Same-Origin Policy (SOP):
        Restricts how a script from one origin can interact with the resources of a different origin.
        This rule protects modern web applications.
